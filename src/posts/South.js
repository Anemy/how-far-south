    'It ends, as most things do. As far South as Cuenca Ecuador. 1 year of bicycling, some amount of miles, a few thousand net feet. I have changed Iâ€™m sure. I have shed some of the weight I have carried with me and am lighter now. ',

    'The world isnâ€™t falling apart. Or it is, I guess, in the way it always does. But biking is done for now. And how inanely unceremonious that is. To wake up the same way I do most days. And have walls surrounding me. The same walls, in the same place, every morning. And people that I have known for 25 years at the table for breakfast. Everyone speaks in a language I understand. And still it changes. Every day. An internal world revolving and searching. Bike across the world and you will still be the same distance from yourself. And hopefully find more joy in that close proximity. ',

    'I biked the last section of my trip with my friend Alex Wolz on the Trans Ecuador Mountain Bike Route. It was probably the hardest riding of the entire trip. Blasted by 50mph winds at a constant 12000+ feet of elevation. With daily massive climbs to the bases of towering volcanoes. ',

    'A routine of awe to naw. From summits to valleys. Lush rivers to raw moon scapes. To the volcanoes of Quilotoa and Chimborazo all the way up to 16000 feet. Ecuador was stunning. It was as if the mountains were stitched together by high elevation farms of quinoa and potatoes. The most insane section of biking is when we decided to go off route and follow Google Maps. What we ended up on would give anxiety to even the most fearless goat. A narrow single track teetering on the edge off a cliff. So small that there was no way to even turn around. It started scary and the cliff just grew. The trail only shrank. In the end we were carrying our bikes while practically sliding down the mountainside on the precipice of disaster. But here I am writing as a living person. And we crossed the steam at the bottom safely with a final glance back up. The rest of the biking was hard but safe. We stayed in some beautiful places like the Black Sheep Inn which treated us like kings with unlimited banana bread. We celebrated Alexâ€™s birthday there with a soak in the wood fire hot tub. We camped in fields of wildflowers and on hills with winds blasting at our tents. It was amazing biking with Alex and exploring village to village in Ecuador.',

    'Families living their life with flocks of sheep is not something so common in Oakland, CA. Families who live by the calendar of potatoes and quinoa. Working with bright, beautiful outfits that look to me like formal wear. It is in meeting people like this that you realize the lack of universality in your aspirations. The beauty of your life has nothing to do with how others have defined your success. Be a sheep CEO. A potato CFO. Social media manager for your cows. And when pandemic strikes. Go home and be with your family.',

And the borders closed and I find myself home with family an instant later. Teleported by the modern era across the world in 10 hours. 1 year of biking, 10 hours of flying. ',
