  'Let the world project as I melt into my seat threatened to be blown abroad by the wind. Let toes be numb and legs keep moving until walls look like home. When it is time to eat gulp it down, let pedaling become a noun.',
  'The movement of your body is marked by meditations of the soul and before synchronicity their must be constent simplicity. An eternal calmness in constant duress as one becomes the other. With no more tether we have lost who we are and are alone in freedom christened by a nearness to the clouds.'
