Day 5 - Starting the nutter butter diet. Seattle's archipelago offers abundance of beautiful scenes; mountains, marshes, woodlands covered with fir trees, based by fjords and streams.

We followed the hood canal into Olympia, Washington's capital. In Olympia we used an app called warmshowers for the first time. Warmshowers is a way for cyclists to find places to put up a tent or crash on a couch for a night - couchsurfing for bikers. That night we stayed with Beth & Pete, their 3 kids, and their sock stealing puppy Raven.

I'm living in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present kiss my ass
