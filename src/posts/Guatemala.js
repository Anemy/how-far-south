    'Through the misfortune of having my camera accidentally kicked down a volcano and losing my phone this post will be rather sparse on pictures. You will have to read kind of like a book or something and just imagine all the pretty volcanoes. ',

    'I left off in the last post in Oaxaca, Mexico and am now writing 2 months later from Leon, Nicaragua. 4 countries, countless mosquito bites, and one good bike ride. ',

    'I started from Oaxaca to Puerto Escondido, a world famous surf town, on a bikepacking route through quiet mountain towns culminating in a 6000 ft descent down to Puerto. On the way I spent a night in a police station which is one thing most people try explicitly to avoid but it worked wonderfully for me. I also took a good fall at the beginning of the descent and had to rattle my bruised and bloody body down the next 5000+ ft of rocky road. I spent a week in Puerto playing ukulele on the beach and drinking mango smoothies before I kept chugging along the coast.',

    'It was hot and humid enough on the coast that over the next 5 days my sweat never dried. I wouldn’t have been too surprised to find mosquitoes breeding in my shorts. Eventually I found respite heading towards the mountains and some of my first bike friends in Tuxtla and San Cristobal. ',

    'I had the joy of staying in a casa de ciclistas with Argentine bike tourers Gabriel and Maribel who are embodied sunshine before heading to San Cristobal and another informal casa de ciclistas called Omar’s. It is a collection of cabanas nestled at the outskirt of the city. I met 5 other bike tourers there: Oneg and Diana, Isreali and American fellow trans Americas tourers, Mimia and Diego, Venezuelan and Argentine tourers who gifted me with current dangly star earrings, and Tim, who just sold his bike and now rides a motorcycle which is questionable karma. ',

    'All of the people I met are street vendors of some sort, selling cookies, falafel, earrings, necklaces, and Gabriel is a fantastic juggler. It was amazing spending nights with them walking down the street and being a part of the street artist community. I’ll never forget everyone dancing and singing and gabriel flinging his light up bowling pins while Pikachu serenaded us with Despacito. It was wonderful, but you know what they say about South-bound souls; “South they go”.',

    'And in this moment they go south quickly to get a chance to again see Alba, a special new friend who co-penned the new chart topping ukulele ballad, ‘Postcard from a Bald Bear’. I biked with all my strength into my first new country in months, Guatemala, and battled its constant hills. I had finally started to be able to understand what people were saying about me in Mexico but I get into the mountains and everyone is speaking the local language. I loved the fresh mountain mornings. Greeting Guatemalan families brightly clad in bright purples, yellows, reds, and blues, waling winding roads to church or work. ',

    'I got to Lake Atitlan and Alba after 4 hard days and one final insane 10km descent that even my brakes couldn’t combat. The lake is beautiful, ringed by towering volcanoes, but my favorite part is that instead of buses people get to ride boats. I don’t know what it is exactly about boats but I could happily ride with the wind whipping through my hair for the entire day. After romping around the towns along the lake we headed to Antigua. ',

    'Antigua is a historic city that was once the capital of Spanish Colonial Central America before being rocked by an earthquake and the capital being moved the next valley over to what is now Guatemala City. Colonial churches sit with toppled stone pillars strewn within. I was hosted for a week by an old counselor of mine, Patrick and his wife Mary-Anne. My stay was highlighted by a hike up the volcano Acatenango (and seeing my good friend Camila).',

    'Acatenango is stunning, climbing 5000m to a lunar expanse of pumice at the summit. The real excitement however, sits next door at Volcano Fuego. Every 20 minutes it lets loose a ground tremoring eruption, smoke billowing out the top. The show starts at night where the darkness illuminates the bright red magma coating the volcano with each explosion. In an attempt to photograph the volcano I set my camera up for a long exposure picture and it was knocked off into the volcanic oblivion. Here is a beautiful photo someone else took that night. ',

    'Leaving Antigua and my beloved camera I biked to Guatemala City and my next technological disaster - I lost my phone. I spent a day looking for it when I received a message out of the blue saying ‘I have your phone’. (Thank god my passcode was 1234.) ',

    'Meanwhile I had given up on it and bought a cheap phone with a new SIM. It turned out the SIM was connected to another person’s Whatsapp already so I received a barrage of calls and texts as stand in Diego over the next few days. He is going through a very turbulent time right now with his school shutting down and work shortages but I hope he is okay. ',

    'Meanwhile I sat in limbo for 4 days waiting for the guy with my phone to message me to meet up but he never sent another message after the fated ‘I have your phone’. Eventually I gave up and headed to the country I had feared since the beginning - El Salvador.',

    'Arriving in El Salvador was chaotic with coyotes swarming, trying to change money with me. I started exchanging with one and they offered me half of what I should have gotten. The weird part was that they typed the correct numbers into their calculator but it spit out that lower number. It kept spitting out slightly higher numbers until it was roughly correct and I took it. I don’t know how they rigged their calculators but it was a sneaky scam. ',

    'After, they offered to help me cross the border (free) for $50 and I kindly declined. The actual crossing took 5 minutes and I was wearily off to the country allegedly filled with violence and crime that I had read so much about, but my first night helped put my fears at rest.',

    'I ended up sleeping with a family after buying some snacks from their store and asking if I could set my tent up in their yard. They were confused at first but after playing uke with their kids and doing some short english lessons they invited me in and treated me like family. Well maybe not 100% like family because all 3 women of the house were hitting on me and I got a couple marriage proposals. Leaving, the abuelo gave me a teary-eyed hug and said I will always be her son.',

    'I biked through El Salvador in 6 days, never running into any danger and being welcomed with open arms by families and firefighters. The only thing I struggled with is constantly being yelled at while I biked.',

    'Kids yelling gringo whenever they saw me was fine, but groups of men unfailingly yelling whatever english words they could muster wore on me. My favorites were people yelling ‘big boy’ and ‘bike boy’ and I got a lot of ‘go go go’s and ‘how are you’s’. But paired with the brutal sun, I eventually started to resent it. It is something I know rationally I shouldn’t be bothered by, being the strange gringo on the bike, but for some reason it got to me.',

    'Otherwise El Salvador was surf beaches, volcano vistas, and pupusas until you explode. Once I got to the South border I found a boat with some fisherman and headed straight to Nicaragua. It almost felt like I was being marooned, dropped off in Potosi on a deserted beach next to a crumbling pier. I slept there a night next to foraging pigs before heading to Leon and the cafe I am sitting in right now. ',

    'Tomorrow I will go volcano biking down silty volcanic ash and the rest is yet to be seen. The adventure still continues and South go, hopefully with more pictures in the future. ',
